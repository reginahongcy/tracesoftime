## Using the code
To use the code for your own project, place the files within your own theme folder, which should be within your **wp-content** folder. 

You will also need to:

1. Have the files for the WordPress **twentytwenty theme** within the **wp-content** folder, and 
2. Install the following plug-ins:
- Advanced Custom Fields (for metadata entry)
- ACF: Better Search (to pull information from ACF into search box)
- Search Exclude (for excluding “About” section pages and front page from search results; only Resources, Objects, Guides posts will appear in search)
- WP Extended Search (WPES) (to include tags into search terms)
- WP MapIt by Chandni Patel (to plot items onto a map)

Remember to change the variable names in the various PHP files to the ones you used in your own project. 
For example, "ad-image" should be replaced with "image" if that is what you used in for your ACF Field Group name.
